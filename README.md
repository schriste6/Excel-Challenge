# Title: **Predicting a Play's Success or Failure Using Historical Data**  

## Overview of Project: 
Louise has been working on a play she'd like to bring to the public.  Many plays that came before have ranged from great success to big failure.  Louis is interested in using data to help plan next steps to launching a successful play.   

### Purpose:  
Determine if historical data can offer insight if funding and/or launch date predict successful interest from the public.

## Analysis and Challenges:  
Historical data does suggest Theater successes based on month launched, but data is at least four-years old and doesn't account for recent trending.  

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date:  
Theater outcomes when launched in May, Jun, Jul are most successful.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
  --Funding needs and launch dates can influence success of a theater production.  
- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
  --Lower funding needs are more prevelant and have more success.
- What are some limitations of this dataset?
  --The data are older and don't reflect recent changes that might impact success.
- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
  --A mixed chart showing volumes and outcomes on one chart would  represent volumes.
