# Title: **Predicting a Play's Success or Failure Using Historical Data**  
---
## Overview of Project: 
Louise has been working on a play she'd like to bring to the public.  Many plays that came before have ranged from great success to big failure.  Louis is interested in using data to help plan next steps to launching a successful play.   

Many factors play into success or failure and data used for decision making is a best practice.  Let's see how data can help Louise plan the outcome of her play.

### Purpose:  
Determine if historical data can offer insight if funding and/or launch date predict successful interest from the public.
---
## Analysis and Challenges:  
Historical data does suggest Theater has success based on month launched.  However, it is important to note that most recent data is from 2017, and cannot account for recent changes impacted by public interests and environmental changes.
Additionally, smaller budget theater productions have the greatest volumes.  Volumes of Theater trend down as funding needs trend up.   

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date:  
Theater outcomes  launched in May, Jun, Jul are most successful.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
>Theater outcomes with funding needs below $5000 have the highest success rates.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
>More genre level detail might offer more insight into what might interest the public; drama, musical, comedy, etc. 
## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?  
    *Funding needs and launch dates can influence success of a theater production.*
- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?  
    *Lower funding needs are more prevelant and have more success.*
- What are some limitations of this dataset?   
    *The data are older and don't reflect recent changes that might impact success.*
- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?  
    *A mixed chart showing play volumes as bars and play outcomes as lines on a single chart would  represent a combination of variables.*
